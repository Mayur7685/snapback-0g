> **AI-Powered, Web3-Enabled Complaint Resolution for Quick Commerce**

SnapBack revolutionizes the way complaints are handled in fast-paced delivery  (Quick Commerce) and e-commerce platforms (like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, etc.). By harnessing the power of AI and blockchain, SnapBack delivers instant, transparent, and automated resolutions for customer complaints turning frustration into satisfaction in seconds.

## üöÄ What is SnapBack?
SnapBack is a next-generation platform that automates the entire complaint resolution process for quick commerce and e-commerce. Users submit complaints (text and images), which are validated by advanced AI models. If valid, refunds or discounts are processed instantly via smart contracts, and every resolution is recorded immutably on-chain.

### Key Features
- **AI Validation:** Automated analysis of complaint images and text using vision-language models (VLMs).
- **Instant Resolutions:** Smart contracts trigger immediate refunds or discounts‚Äîno more waiting.
- **NFT Proofs:** Each resolved complaint is minted as an NFT for tamper-proof, auditable records.
- **Token Rewards:** Users earn tokens for engagement, redeemable for discounts or perks.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works with food delivery, groceries, and broader e-commerce.
- **Web3 Integration:** Secure logins via crypto wallets; decentralized storage (IPFS/Filecoin).

### Benefits
- **For Users:** Instant, fair resolutions, rewards, and transparent records.
- **For Businesses:** Reduced operational costs, streamlined CX, and increased trust.

## ü§ñ How SnapBack Works

### Traditional Userflow
1. User receives delivery (food, groceries, etc.).
2. User finds an issue (e.g., undercooked food, spoiled groceries).
3. User complains to the platform.
4. Gets stuck in chatbot/call center loops, delayed or minimized refunds.

### SnapBack + 0G Userflow
1. User receives delivery.
2. User finds an issue.
3. User submits complaint to SnapBack (web, WhatsApp, Telegram).
4. Uploads details, images, and text.
5. AI + on-chain logic validate the claim.
6. Refund or cashback is issued instantly!
7. Resolution is minted as an NFT for proof.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** Modern web app (React/TS), chat integrations (WhatsApp, Telegram).
- **AI Analysis:**
  - **Image:** Vision-language models (VLMs) analyze complaint images (currently off-chain, moving toward on-chain as 0G compute matures).
  - **Text:** On-chain text analysis using service providers.
- **Smart Contracts:**
  - Automate refunds, discounts, and NFT minting.
  - Store proofs and complaint data on-chain.
- **Web3 Storage:** IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized, tamper-proof complaint evidence.
- **0G Compute (Planned):** Final verdicts powered by 0G compute providers (e.g., DeepSeek R1), enabling fully on-chain, verifiable AI.

# üåå Why 0G?

0G is the first decentralized AI Layer 1 chain, purpose-built to power scalable, verifiable AI on-chain. It solves the biggest hurdles for decentralized AI:
- **Massive storage** for AI datasets and evidence
- **Scalable compute** for running AI models and validations
- **Low-latency, high-throughput chain** for instant resolutions
- **Data availability** to guarantee access and auditability

### 0G Components Used in SnapBack
- **0G Storage:** Store complaint data, images, and model proofs economically and securely.
- **0G Compute:** Run AI models and validation logic on a decentralized GPU network (future integration).
- **0G Chain:** Execute smart contracts for refunds, rewards, and NFT minting.

### Vision & Mission
- **AI as a Public Good:** SnapBack and 0G share the vision of democratizing AI‚Äîmaking it transparent, fair, and accessible.
- **Open Infrastructure:** Anyone can contribute, audit, and benefit from the system.
